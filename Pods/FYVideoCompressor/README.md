# FYVideoCompressor

A high-performance, flexible and easy to use Video compressor library written by Swift. Using hardware-accelerator APIs in AVFoundation. You can add `Bitrate`, `FPS`, and other filters.

## Usage

### Compress with quality param

```swift
public enum VideoQuality: Equatable {
        /// Scale video size proportionally, not large than 224p and
        /// reduce fps and bit rate if need.
        case lowQuality

        /// Scale video size proportionally, not large than 480p and
        /// reduce fps and bit rate if need.
        case mediumQuality

        /// Scale video size proportionally, not large than 1080p and
        /// reduce fps and bit rate if need.
        case highQuality

        /// reduce fps and bit rate if need.
        /// Scale video size with specified `scale`.
        case custom(fps: Float, bitrate: Int, scale: CGSize)
}
```

Set `VideoQuality` to get different quality of video, beside, you can set custom fps, bitrate and scale:

```swift
FYVideoCompressor().compressVideo(yourVideoPath, quality: .lowQuality) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let compressedVideoURL):
            case .failure(let error):
            }
 }
```

### Compress with more customized configuration param

```swif
// Compression Encode Parameters
public struct CompressionConfig {
    //Tag: video

    /// Config video bitrate.
    /// If the input video bitrate is less than this value, it will be ignored.
    /// bitrate use 1000 for 1kbps. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate.
    /// Default is 1Mbps
    public var videoBitrate: Int

    /// A key to access the maximum interval between keyframes. 1 means key frames only, H.264 only. Default is 10.
    public var videomaxKeyFrameInterval: Int //

    /// If video's fps less than this value, this value will be ignored. Default is 24.
    public var fps: Float

    //Tag: audio

    /// Sample rate must be between 8.0 and 192.0 kHz inclusive
    /// Default 44100
    public var audioSampleRate: Int

    /// Default is 128_000
    /// If the input audio bitrate is less than this value, it will be ignored.
    public var audioBitrate: Int

    /// Default is mp4
    public var fileType: AVFileType

    /// Scale (resize) the input video
    /// 1. If you need to simply resize your video to a specific size (e.g 320Ã—240), you can use the scale: CGSize(width: 320, height: 240)
    /// 2. If you want to keep the aspect ratio, you need to specify only one component, either width or height, and set the other component to -1
    ///    e.g CGSize(width: 320, height: -1)
    public var scale: CGSize?
}
```

Configure your configuration, then compress your video:

```swift
let config = FYVideoCompressor.CompressionConfig(videoBitrate: 1000_000,
                                                videomaxKeyFrameInterval: 10,
                                                fps: 24,
                                                audioSampleRate: 44100,
                                                audioBitrate: 128_000,
                                                fileType: .mp4,
                                                scale: CGSize(width: 640, height: 480))
FYVideoCompressor().compressVideo(yourVideoPath, config: config) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let compressedVideoURL):
    case .failure(let error):
    }
}
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate FYVideoCompressor into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'FYVideoCompressor'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding FYVideoCompressor as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/T2Je/FYVideoCompressor.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.6"))
]
```
